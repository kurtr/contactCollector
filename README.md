# contactCollector
Contact Collector is a cookie based people tracker wrapped in a jQuery plugin for easy implementation. Its currently a small 
side project im working on to reduce abandoned cart's on an e-commerce site. Basically Its is designed to update the server 
generated cookies with with any valid email address entered by the user on any page it is implemented on. I have found that
alot of end users either only partially complete the sign up proccess when checking out or abandon thier cart when they can't
remember thier password. Tracking the users input allows for a higher rate of cart recovery since It allows you to send a
cart reminder email even when a user has not completed thier registration proccess.
