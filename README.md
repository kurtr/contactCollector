Contact Collector is a cookie based people tracker wrapped in a jQuery plugin for easy implementation. Its currently a small 
side project im working on to reduce abandoned cart's on an e-commerce site. Basically Its is designed to update the server 
generated cookies with with any valid email address entered by the user on any page it is implemented on. 

Tracking the user input allows for a higher rate of cart recovery since It allows you to send a cart reminder email even when 
a user has not completed thier registration proccess.
